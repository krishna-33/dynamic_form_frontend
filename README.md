# Approach #
After reading the task details, i recognized that it is similar like google form, admin can create form & user can add response. I have like the concept of project, where admin can add fields as per their requirement.

When imeplementing ptoject, i got stuck into fixing error in saving checkbox & radio box options in frontend. After debugging code, i made changes in code to fix the issue.
